<h2>About this project</h2>
	<p>
		DoctAR is a concept application that connects doctors in remote regions to medical specialists. The specialist will be able to examine the patient through an AR lens worn by the operating doctor, get access to real-time vital signs, and provide insights through voice and AR annotation. <br><br>The project was completed in two hours during a wearable XR design contest. The contest prompt was to "design a wearable XR solution to solve a real world, human problem" and perform a demonstration of the design through non-digital media.

<h2>My role</h2>

<h2>The story: Alaskaâ€™s Traveling Patients</h2>

<p>
In the 21st century, healthcare is more accessible for remote regions than ever before. But Alaskans still may need to travel outside, often to the Pacific Northwest, for specialized treatment for burns, transplants, neurological, cardiac, or pediatric conditions. Approximately 60 patients are flown to Seattle each month.
</p>
<br>
<h3>The problem</h3>
		<ul class="boxlist">
			<li>Patients are spending valuable time on travel before receiving care from specialists</li>
			<li>High cost associated with using air ambulances</li>
			<li>Getting treated at another location takes patients away from their community and support network </li>
		</ul>
